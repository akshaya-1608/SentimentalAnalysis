# 🎭 Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

This Python project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to classify movie reviews as **Positive 😊** or **Negative 😞**.

It utilizes the **NLTK movie\_reviews** dataset, `CountVectorizer` for feature extraction, and a **Naive Bayes Classifier** for prediction. It also includes a live terminal interface for testing custom reviews.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Trains on labeled movie reviews
* Classifies custom input reviews live in the terminal
* Displays accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
* Visualizes results using Seaborn and Matplotlib

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas nltk matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn termcolor
```

Download the NLTK dataset:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('movie_reviews')
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Save the code as `app.py` and execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once trained, you’ll be prompted to enter your own reviews.

## 💬 Sample Inputs

Try entering these when prompted:

### ✅ Positive Examples:

* `I absolutely loved this movie!`
* `The plot was amazing and the acting was top-notch.`
